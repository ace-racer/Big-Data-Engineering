Installation Steps


Step 1 - Verifying Java Installation
Hopefully you have already installed java on your machine right now, so you just verify it using the following command.
$ java -version
If java is successfully installed on your machine, you could see the version of the installed Java.
Step 1.1 - Download JDK
If Java is not downloaded, please download the latest version of JDK by visiting the following link and download latest version.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Now the latest version is JDK 8u 60 and the file is “jdk-8u60-linux-x64.tar.gz”. Please download the file on your machine.
Step 1.2 - Extract Files
Generally, files being downloaded are stored in the downloads folder, verify it and extract the tar setup using the following commands.
$ cd /go/to/download/path
$ tar -zxf jdk-8u60-linux-x64.gz
Step 1.3 - Move to Opt Directory
To make java available to all users, move the extracted java content to usr/local/java/ folder.
$ su
password: (type password of root user)
$ mkdir /opt/jdk
$ mv jdk-1.8.0_60 /opt/jdk/
Step 1.4 - Set path
To set path and JAVA_HOME variables, add the following commands to ~/.bashrc file.
export JAVA_HOME =/usr/jdk/jdk-1.8.0_60
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
Now apply all the changes into current running system.
$ source ~/.bashrc
Step 1.5 - Java Alternatives
Use the following command to change Java Alternatives.
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk/jdk1.8.0_60/bin/java 100
Step 1.6 − Now verify java using verification command (java -version) explained in Step 1.
Step 2 - ZooKeeper Framework Installation
Step 2.1 - Download ZooKeeper
To install ZooKeeper framework on your machine, visit the following link and download the latest version of ZooKeeper.
http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html
As of now, latest version of ZooKeeper is 3.4.13 (ZooKeeper-3.4.13.tar.gz).
Step 2.2 - Extract tar file
Extract tar file using the following command
$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf zookeeper-3.4.12.tar.gz
$ sudo ln -s /opt/zookeeper-3.4.12 /opt/zookeeper
$ cd zookeeper
$ mkdir data
Step 2.3 - Create Configuration File
Open Configuration File named conf/zoo.cfg using the command vi “conf/zoo.cfg” and all the following parameters to set as starting point.
$ vi conf/zoo.cfg
tickTime=2000
dataDir=/path/to/zookeeper/data
clientPort=2181
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
Once the configuration file has been saved successfully and return to terminal again, you can start the zookeeper server.
Step 2.4 - Start ZooKeeper Server
$ bin/zkServer.sh start
After executing this command, you will get a response as shown below −
$ JMX enabled by default
$ Using config: /Users/../zookeeper/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
$ Starting zookeeper ... STARTED
Step 2.5 - Start CLI
$ bin/zkCli.sh
After typing the above command, you will be connected to the zookeeper server and will get the below response.
Connecting to localhost:2181
................
................
................
Welcome to ZooKeeper!
................
................
WATCHER::
WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type: None path:null
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0]
Step 2.6 - Stop Zookeeper Server
After connecting the server and performing all the operations, you can stop the zookeeper server with the following command −
$ bin/zkServer.sh stop
Now you have successfully installed Java and ZooKeeper on your machine. Let us see the steps to install Apache Kafka.
Step 3 - Apache Kafka Installation
Let us continue with the following steps to install Kafka on your machine.
Step 3.1 - Download Kafka
To install Kafka on your machine, click on the below link −
https://www-us.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.1.0/kafka_2.12-2.1.0.tgz
Now the latest version i.e., – kafka_2.12-2.1.0.tgz will be downloaded onto your machine.
Step 3.2 - Extract the tar file
Extract the tar file using the following command −
$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf kafka_2.12-2.1.0.tgz
$ sudo ln -s /opt/kafka_2.12-2.1.0 /opt/kafka
$ cd kafka
Now you have downloaded the latest version of Kafka on your machine.
Step 3.3 - Start Server
You can start the server by giving the following command −
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
After the server starts, you would see the below response on your screen −
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
[2016-01-02 15:37:30,410] INFO KafkaConfig values:
request.timeout.ms = 30000
log.roll.hours = 168
inter.broker.protocol.version = 0.9.0.X
log.preallocate = false
security.inter.broker.protocol = PLAINTEXT
…………………………………………….
…………………………………………….
Step 4 - Stop the Server
After performing all the operations, you can stop the server using the following command −
$ bin/kafka-server-stop.sh config/server.properties
Now that we have already discussed the Kafka installation, we can learn how to perform basic operations on Kafka in the next chapter.


Apache Kafka - Basic Operation
Modify .bash_profile or .profile


export KAFKA_HOME=/opt/kafka


Start Zookeeper


sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh -daemon $KAFKA_HOME/config/zookeeper.properties


Start Kafka Broker


sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh -daemon $KAFKA_HOME/config/server.properties


Single Node-Single Broker Configuration
In this configuration you have a single ZooKeeper and broker id instance. Following are the steps to configure it −
Creating a Kafka Topic − Kafka provides a command line utility named kafka-topics.sh to create topics on the server. Open new terminal and type the below example.
Syntax
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic topic-name
Example
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic Hello-Kafka
We just created a topic named Hello-Kafka with a single partition and one replica factor. The above created output will be similar to the following output −
Output − Created topic Hello-Kafka
Once the topic has been created, you can get the notification in Kafka broker terminal window and the log for the created topic specified in “/tmp/kafka-logs/“ in the config/server.properties file.
List of Topics
To get a list of topics in Kafka server, you can use the following command −
Syntax
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
Output
Hello-Kafka
Since we have created a topic, it will list out Hello-Kafka only. Suppose, if you create more than one topics, you will get the topic names in the output.
Start Producer to Send Messages
Syntax
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 —topic topic-name
From the above syntax, two main parameters are required for the producer command line client −
Broker-list − The list of brokers that we want to send the messages to. In this case we only have one broker. The Config/server.properties file contains broker port id, since we know our broker is listening on port 9092, so you can specify it directly.
Topic name − Here is an example for the topic name.
Example
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic Hello-Kafka
The producer will wait on input from stdin and publishes to the Kafka cluster. By default, every new line is published as a new message then the default producer properties are specified in config/producer.properties file. Now you can type a few lines of messages in the terminal as shown below.
Output
$ sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic Hello-Kafka
[2016-01-16 13:50:45,931] WARN property topic is not valid (kafka.utils.Verifia-bleProperties)
Hello
My first message
My second message
Start Consumer to Receive Messages
Similar to producer, the default consumer properties are specified in config/consumer.properties file. Open a new terminal and type the below syntax for consuming messages.
Syntax
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic topic-name --from-beginning
Example
sudo $KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic Hello-Kafka --from-beginning
Output
Hello
My first message
My second message
Finally, you are able to enter messages from the producer’s terminal and see them appearing in the consumer’s terminal. As of now, you have a very good understanding on the single node cluster with a single broker. Let us now move on to the multiple brokers configuration.
